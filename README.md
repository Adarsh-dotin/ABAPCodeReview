# Smart ABAP Code Analyzer & Optimizer

## Overview
This project is a **web-based ABAP Code Analyzer** that provides optimization suggestions, best practices, and potential anti-pattern detection for ABAP code. It leverages **OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini** model to analyze code and return structured feedback.

## Features
- **ABAP Code Input**: Paste your ABAP code for analysis.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Identifies performance issues, anti-patterns, and best practices.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI built with React.
- **JSON-Based Suggestions**: The AI returns structured feedback with optimization recommendations.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18
- **Backend**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini API
- **Hosting**: ESM.sh for module loading

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/abap-code-analyzer.git
   cd abap-code-analyzer
   ```
2. Run a local development server (e.g., using Node.js or a static server like Vite).
3. Open the app in a browser and paste your ABAP code for analysis.

## API Endpoint
- **`POST /analyze`**: Sends ABAP code to OpenAI for analysis and returns structured JSON suggestions.

## Example API Request
```json
{
  "code": "SELECT * FROM mara INTO TABLE lt_mara."
}
```

## Example API Response
```json
{
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "type": "Performance",
      "description": "Consider using SELECT SINGLE or adding WHERE conditions to improve efficiency."
    },
    {
      "type": "Best Practice",
      "description": "Use OPEN SQL best practices for better performance."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Future Enhancements
- **Integrate ALV Grid Display for better output visualization.**
- **Enhance AI response with more structured insights.**
- **Add authentication for secure API access.**
